The sequel prototype is based on two cooperative players lifting and throwing each other, lifting and stacking objects, and scrolling the screen upward â€” a design too complex for the Famicom hardware and with dissatisfying gameplay. This ambitious concept was postponed in favor of a quicker upgrade to the original Super Mario Bros. engine, released in Japan as the notoriously challenging Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario team resumed development of the prototype for another interim game, Yume KÅjÅ: Doki Doki Panic (1987). Instead of Mario graphics, this advergame was branded with the characters and themes of Fuji Television\'s technology expo called Yume KÅjÅ \'87 (lit. \"Dream Factory\"). Nintendo of America decided Japan\'s Super Mario Bros. 2 had gameplay too frustratingly difficult and too similar to Super Mario Bros. to be worth releasing into the recently crashed American market.
